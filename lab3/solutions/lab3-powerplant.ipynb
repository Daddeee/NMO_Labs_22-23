    "A large power company wants to plan its capacity expansion for the next 10 years. The forecasted demand in megawatts for year $t \\in \\{1, . . . , 10\\}$ is denoted by $d_t$, and is provided in the following table:\n",

    "The company can expand its energy production capacity at the beginning of each year. Two energy production alternatives are available: nuclear and wind.\n",

    "* An investment of $c_n = 100$ is required per megawatt of nuclear power. Such an investment in the beginning of year t implies that the purchased capacity will be available during period t, t + 1, t + 2 and t + 3.\n",
